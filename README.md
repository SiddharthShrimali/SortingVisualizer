# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

• Implemented 5+ sorting algorithms, including Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort, Selection, and Radix Sort with a
      modular approach, allowing future addition of new sorting algorithms.

• Developed a graphical visualizer using SDL that animates the sorting process, giving an overview of algorithm
      behavior.
      
• Created a maintainable codebase, allowing future additions or improvements to the visualizer.
